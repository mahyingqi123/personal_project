('Rate This Uni 是什么？', '\r\n    这篇文章主要是讲述成立这个网站的原因，和之后可能会面对的难题。Ratethisuni.com这个想法其实是引用美国的RateMyProfessors.com和RateMyDorm.com的概念。记得前几个月有一位叫Jedcal的youtuber做了类似的网站，并且浏览量挺高的，这就是启发我的原因。有了professor，有了dormitory。马上就想到了university，很自然的，网站名字就应该是Ratethisuni.com，因为Ratethisuniversity.com太长了。Ratethisuni.com主要是让学生们有一个可以发声的平台，还有让新生们对自己的选择有一个更清晰了解。\r\n    \r\n    可能你会问，那Ratethisuni.com和其他的University Ranking Website 有什么不同？首先，和其他像QS 和TIMES,那样的大学排名网站不一样的是，Ratethisuni.com可以让你在这个平台上写下自己的想法，无论你的评论是好的还是坏的，只要是理性的就可以出现在这个平台。第二，Ratethisuni.com并不是一个大学排名网站，我们单纯只是为学生们提供一个写下自己感想的平台，而单凭学生的想法，目前我们是不会为各校做出排名的。第三，Ratethisuni.com目前只面向马来西亚的学生，不像其他的网站，我们只专注在马来西亚的大学，因此我们会尽可能地把每一所马来西亚的大学加到我们的网站内。\r\n\r\n    相信大部分人都了解过马来西亚的教育体制，若是不了解的，我在这里稍作解释。马来西亚教育体制中的某种制度，对于某些族群不太友好，使他们无法确定自己读完中六后能否考上国立大学。不仅如此，因为马来西亚教育体制的原因，导致中六生比私立大学的学生要慢上大学，比如就一般读foundation的学生，19岁便开始上大学了，而就读中六的学生则需等到20岁末才能上大学，整整慢了一年，这在亚洲这种“怕输”的环境，很大可能是大家拒绝中六的原因。接下来，便是中六的考试制度，据我了解，STPM的考试Skema Jawapan/Marking Scheme非常不稳定，这一次的答对，可能是下一次的错误，这也是部分人拒绝中六的原因。这点我深有感触,因为我的SPM Moral曾经只有37分。这里我们暂且不提Matrikulasi，Asasi这些不一样的情况。\r\n\r\n    （以上仅为个人想法，如不赞同，欢迎您联络我们，在这里发表自己的想法。）\r\n\r\n    言归正传，种种原因导致一大部分学生需要到像TARUC，Taylor’s或是INTI这样的私立大学就读。但是私立大学不像国立大学，国立大学都是需要通过UPU这样的网站/机构申请的，并且每个人到最后只能得到一所大学的录取通知，所以在国立大学，选择的机会较少。这种情况在私立大学便不复存在，学生们可以选择任意一所大学，并且通常都会被录取（前提是在达到录取资格）。这样的情况便导致学生们陷入“我该选那所大学？”这个难题。这时候Ratethisuni.com的用处就显现出来了，学生们可以在这里点开自己感兴趣的大学，然后阅读在籍生对自己大学的评论，再根据自己的需求选择自己想要的大学。那当然，报读国立大学前，学生们也可以浏览Ratethisuni来当作参考。\r\n\r\n    可能有人会说，想要看大学的口碑，为什么不去一些社交平台，例如Facebook，Quora, Reddit，等等。甚至说为什么不直接看Google Review？上述的平台当然可以使用，也可能有一些比本平台更有用的资讯。但是Ratethisuni.com的存在也为你们提供了一个更集中的资讯中心，让学生们不必浪费时间去各种平台寻找资料。再来就是最近流传的某大学学生投诉自己的学校的考试制度，当发生这样的事件时，在籍生便可以通过我们这样的平台发声，也让未来想上该大学的学生可以再三考虑，甚至可以引起校方的主意，让校方就此作出改进。\r\n\r\n    接下来便是Ratethisuni.com未来可能会遇到的难题，第一个便是法律问题，像Ratethisuni.com这样的平台其实非常容易被大学采取法律行动。举个例子，如果有人在平台上写下了影响大学声誉的言论，Ratethisuni.com很可能就会被大学提告。毕竟教育事业是一门大生意，流失的一位学生就是几万令吉，甚至几十万令吉的损失。像MalaysiaKini就是前车之鉴，因为一些用户留下的恶意评论，导致该平台必须缴付RM500,000的罚款。所以为了避免这样的事情重演，我们只能尽量排除一些过于偏激的言论，也希望用户不会留下一些带有恶意的评论。第二，平台管理问题。要知道网站维持并不是免费的，而是需要缴付一些费用给网上伺服器来维持的。要是Ratethisuni.com在一两年内无法达到预期的效果，我们可能就会考虑把这个平台关闭。\r\n\r\n    总而言之，Ratethisuni.com就是一个让大学生和准大学生发表自己的看法和找到自己心仪的大学的一个平台。对于平台上的每一个评论，都是大学生们自己发表的，与本平台无关，Ratethisuni.com仅仅职位大家提供一个平台，不为平台上的言论负任何的责任。希望大家评论时保持理性及理智，谢谢大家。', 1, 'Ying Qi', ' 这篇文章主要是讲述成立这个网站的原因，和之后可能会面对的难题。'),
('What is Rate This Uni?', '     This article is about why we built this website and the problems we might have in the future.  The idea of Ratethisuni.com is from the American website named RateMyProfessors.com and RateMyDorm.com. A few months ago, we came across a YouTuber named Jedcal who made the website named RateMyDorm.com and he inspired me to build my website. With the existence of professor and dormitory. We got the idea of this website right away, the website is named RateThisUni.com because any other domain was taken. The main purpose of Ratethisuni.com is to let students have a platform to voice out their opinions and let the high school graduates have an idea about their choices.\r\n\r\n     Someone might ask, what’s the difference between RateThisUni.com and any other university ranking website?  The difference between RateThisUni.com and sites like QS and TIMES is, Ratethisuni.com allows you to leave your comment on this platform, it doesn’t matter it’s good or it’s bad, as long as it is rational, it will be shown on the site. Secondly, Ratethisuni.com is not a university ranking website, we solely provide a platform for students to voice out their opinions, and we are not able to rank these universities just by what students think. Lastly, Ratethisuni.com only focuses on universities in Malaysia, unlike the other sites, we put all our effort into students in Malaysia, hence we will do our best to include every university on our website.\r\n \r\n     I believe that most Malaysians are familiar with the education system in Malaysia, if you are not, I will explain it briefly here. Due to this poorly designed education system in Malaysia, some of the students are not sure that if they will gain admission to a government university even though they have good results. Besides that, because of the education system, makes those who study public sixth form has slower path than students in private school, let’s take the foundation students as an example, they enter university at the age of 19, but the sixth form students will only enter university at the age of 20. This one-year gap, is unacceptable in this “kiasu” environment in Asia, especially for Chinese parents. Next, look at the STPM exam, according to what I have seen, the marking scheme of the exam is very inconsistent, the correct answer for this time might be wrong for the next time. I am very relatable to this situation as I once receive only 37 marks for Moral in SPM. Normally, these are the reasons why people chose to study in private schools instead of public.\r\n \r\n（These are just my personal thought, if you disagree with me，you are welcomed to contact us and post your idea here!）\r\n \r\n     Back to the topic, these reasons caused students to study in private schools like TARUC, Taylor’s, INTI, etc. But, unlike the public university that need to apply through a system called UPU and students will only be given one option at the end, students have the chance to pick their schools from in the private sector. This leaves students one problem, which is “Which University Should I Choose?!”. Now, I present to you, RateThisUni.com, just click on the university you are interested in, read the comments from the students or ex-students, and pick the school you like the most. Of course, public schools students could also browse RateThisUni.com before applying to a public university and take the information as a reference.\r\n \r\n     Wait, then why don’t we just use those famous platforms like Quora, Reddit, etc? Sure, you can use those platforms, and those platforms might have information that is much more useful than what we have. You can think of Ratethisuni.com as a centre of information that saves you time as you do not need to waste time digging for info from the various platform. You might have seen the news about student complaints about the management of his university, when something like this happened, students can voice out their opinions on our platform, and make the newcomers think twice before they make their decision. Sometimes it might even reach the management of the school, make them improve on a certain matter.\r\n \r\n    And now we have come to what problem RateThisUni.com might encounter, the first one would be legal issues, a platform such as Ratethisuni.com tends to be taken legal actions by universities. As an example, if someone posts a review that might affect the reputation of a school, that particular university will be very likely to take legal actions on RateThisUni.com. Education is a big business after all, by losing one student, the university might lose a few thousand, or even a few hundred thousand of income. Take MalaysiaKini as an example, due to a few malicious comments of users, the platform had to pay a total of RM500,000 fine. So, to avoid something like this from happening, we can only do our best to remove some overly radical comments and wish that users do not leave a comment like this. (If you own any of the institutions on our website but you do not like how we present it, do contact us and we will make it right for you.) Secondly, the problem of maintaining the website. It is a fact that website maintenance is not free, developer has to pay a certain amount of money to keep it running. If RateThisUni.com does not reach the expected result in one or two years, we will have to consider taking down the site.\r\n \r\n    In a conclusion, Ratethisuni.com is a PLATFORM for students to voice out their opinions and high school graduates to pick the university they like the most. For every single comment on the platform, they are posted by students themselves, Ratethisuni.com solely provides a platform for students and RateThisUni.com is not responsible for the comments on this platform. Wish that everyone be rational while leaving a comment, thank you all。', 2, 'Ying Qi', 'This article is about why I built this website and the problems we might have in the future.');

Talking about the facilities, most of them is very new and convenient. Student Centre is always there ready to help students with their issues such as enrolment or payment issues. Also, there are clubs or societies like boxing, dancing etc. , as well as resting rooms equipped with simple games such as pools, ping pong, darts etc. Also, the library is comfortable with self-service book borrowing machine. \r\nTalking about the environment, the best thing is that it is  a nice surrounding to communicate in English. This will force people to improve their speaking and writing skills to have a better communication. The surrounding is still cool for a new uni like HWUM. However, don\'t forget that it is at Putrajaya, it is not so developed and convenient as KL. For HWUM, bus service is provided directly to a few accommodation site (but it takes longer time than a car). If you wish to visit other place, u might need to take the public transport (If you are not familiar with the public transport/ not familiar with the payment/ time doesn\'t match for the schedule, u can only take taxi from MyCar & Grab. Not cheap thooo, especially when u\'re late and missed the school bus hahahhah). AND, since it is not so developed, most of the buildings are gov. building, not so much shopping centre as KL. Most of the food outside of Uni is Malay/ Islamic, followed by Indian and the least is Chinese food. (I\'m just telling what I observed, so you have to get used to it). \r\nTalking about lecture, first of all u have to admit that there are always good and bad lecturers in every school, so I\'m not commenting on that. For current pandemic, HWUM is delivering through online lectures, and enables mixing of Face2face and online lectures if the situation allows. So, what I felt for my course is that, its standard is quite high above the average, quite difficult and worth to study. However, don\'t forget that it a \"branch\" of the Edinburgh HW uni, together with Dubai HW. U can expect for a troublesome schedule, especially when something happened. I will talk about this on MANAGEMENT. \r\nTalking about food, hah, one thing, nice to eat but EXPENSIVE. This is talking about the uni canteen! RM1.5 for a plate of rice, RM 2 for a scoop of vege, RM 3 for a scoop of (non-vege) if I\'m not mistaken; and the quantity is not satisfying sometimes. For drinks, I don\'t think RM 2 or 3 can get a cup of coffee... If you are used to eat cheaper food, then you might ... IN short, the variation of food and drinks is there, but avg price is higher with respect to the quantity, even if compared with Genting Staff canteen. \r\nMANAGEMENT. About the troublesome schedule, when something happens, it takes time to have a so called \"international discussion\" with Edinburgh and Dubai uni. For example the pandemic recently, I can say, HWUM is almost the last school in Malaysia (from what I compared with other uni) to cancel Face2Face class, not until someone wrote to the Provost a.k.a CEO of HWUM, urging Provost to deal with it. I\'m staying at an accommodation (not HWUM\'s), and what I experienced is every student from other school left already, leaving me alone at the accommodation. If I\'m not wrong, the school\'s announcement (on cancelling the F2F session) is very/ extremely near to the gov\'s announcement on 1st MCO. I don\'t know whether it is due to the trouble in discussing with other campus (Edinburgh & Dubai), whether the school management don\'t wish to afford the Income deficit OR whether they can\'t predict the adverse impact (meanwhile,  the China cases was rising wildly). On the other side, about setting academic schedules, it is troublesome to have discussion always with other campus, while my friend at uni like UTAR has FIXED(very fixed) schedule from the beginning of semester. HWUM\'s announcement on the date of assignments, examinations etc. always take time.... and was amended quite frequently to match with other campus. Also one thing I hate the most, SOME lecturers love to upload the slides right before or after the lecture sessions. How ppl gonna study or refer? How ppl gonna discover some doubts before the lecture? It is better now, to have pre-recorded videos for online studies. Hah, one thing I almost missed out. The tuition fees. To be honest, not cheap tho (For UG Mechanical Engineering is like 40k smtg, PG is like 50k smtg, do go and check at the school website). And somemore after the outbreak of virus, the school management insisted on maintaining the original amount of tuition fees (as they claim that students are still using the facilities), meanwhile other uni are reducing the fees for their students. So, 见仁见智，you can still choose HWUM if you can afford this. \r\nOne more thing, students and staffs of HWUM are very friendly. They are nice to students. Also if you left something (for me like laptop or textbooks), you might find it on the original location or get it back from the Lost and Found. Yet, if you\'re currently suffering to stay at Putrajaya, do go to Putrajaya Sentral and take the train to KL.

They got the gym, pool, field, but the main library building is not yet finished (and I heard that they keep saying will finish by the end of the year for a few years already...), therefore, we currently only have a temporarily small library.\r\n\r\nI think you can really take a good picture here, but somehow many places are still under construction so there\'s still some pollution here (noise and water pollution). And personally,I think that it is not that important to have good scenery to study :P. If you talk about the studying environment, I think the class is quite nice, with powerful air cons and many halls (but this is not the same for the computer lab, I will slightly mention later). I\'m not the person who likes to go to the library as it is really stressful to see people studying and somehow makes me even more distracting, so I prefer to lock inside the hostel and read by my own. So I think I won\'t comment much on this.\r\n\r\nFor the lecturers, I think it is just a matter of luck whether you can meet a good lecturer. I can only say maybe some of them are really professional in the field, but they may not have good teaching skills. But in the end, you have to learn things by yourself anyway.\r\n\r\nThere are some stores that sell food at a much cheaper price, like the mixed rice and ban mee, but the rest I think is quite.... or very expensive. (the rest cost you RM 6 and above). And due to the pandemic, I heard that many stores have closed now.\r\n\r\nThe management I think I don\'t need to comment for now, just read other comments I think you will know :D\r\n\r\nTalk about our course, TBH I do not recommend taking DMT here because I personally feel that they did not put much attention on us. Resources provided for us are quite limited, like the VR headsets it is really insufficient for the whole class. The school computers provided to us are actually not powerful enough to support rendering, which makes computers always brokes and makes other people unable to use them. The computer lab is also not 24 hours open, therefore, it is quite inconvenient if you are rushing for some big projects.

So you can see that there is a weird gap for the GPA of A- and B, and this can make your CGPA drop significantly if you can\'t get 80 and above. They even have a quota for people who can get A in a subject. Therefore, you really need to work very hard to get better marks.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is still a very new uni as it was just established for a few years only. Many things still need to be improved. Maybe it will be better in the future, but now I think maybe just research for more uni first before choosing here.', 'Digital Media Technology', 2018, 114, 4, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, '115.134.113.92'),

There\'s a depot where you can borrow equipment such as Zoom H4, Blackmagic Cam, etc for your video production needs. Mocap studios for the 3D guys. Sound recording studio and if you can\'t manage to book the studio. You can always borrow the Scarlett Studio set to do your recording session at your dorm. Newly added FX Lab are equipped with pretty decent machine that can run 3D softwares smoothly. \r\n\r\nHowever... Environment wise, I think it\'s pretty dilapidated because it\'s been 20 years old... and it seems like this Faculty isn\'t in the best interest of MMU so it don\'t get much renovation compared to other faculty. Also the forever unfixed elevator... huh huh\r\n\r\nAbout the lecture/lecturer, without a doubt they are knowledgeable and some of them really put extra effort to make sure the students are okay. Always ready to help, but under one condition which is you yourself are willing to learn. Some of the theory class can be extremely boring though. \r\n\r\nWhat\'s more to say about Food in Faculty of Creative Multimedia? FCM Cafe food best lah, the ayam goreng, maggie goreng, paling best and most of all, they are freaking affordable, definitely below market price if you go dine in outside of campus in Cyberjaya. When you get sick of FCM cafe food, you can always go for a switch in Deen Cafe which is just a walking distance away. My favorite dish is their Nasi Goreng Paprik. Flavor and pricing wise hands down the best in town. \r\n\"CHICKEN CHOP KOMPOKKKK\" isn\'t my favorite but definitely the most ordered dish in this cafe. \r\n\r\nIf we are talking about the management just in our FCM faculty. It\'s a 50, 50. Mr Saddam do his job pretty well and clear things up when you are in doubt about the course. But some of the female staff (not pointing fingers, but I really have no idea about her name) can be a little challenging. She can sounds super annoyed by your enquiry/request, and feel so apathetic. (feels like, why are you bothering me? I\'m trying to chill here, can\'t you see i\'m tired?). If we are talking about the management of MMU in general. Everyone thinks they are shit, during my study, the SRC even brought it to the mainstream media about how shitty our MMU management really are. MONEY is their best interest, not the student\'s, not the lecturer\'s, that is why a lot of my lecturers cabut for good. \r\n\r\nAdditional point, the IDKWTF department near the in-campus hostel. For event purpose, I went to apply for permission for hanging banner, posters. They took my deposit and when the event is over, I want to get back my deposit. I visit the person in charge\'s office for so goddamn many times at different time. He\'s always missing in action. I have even waited there for hour.
