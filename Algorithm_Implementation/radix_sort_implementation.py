def analyze(results, roster, score):
    '''
    A function that analyses the results of matches and return one list containing matches with top 10 scores, 
    and another list with matches that has the same score of higher closest score wtih given score
    Precondition:   Every element in results has the format [team1,team2,score]
                    roster matches the character set in team naming
    Postcondition:  results is modified
    :Input:
        results: A list of matches
        roster:  A number indicating how many characters are there in the team
        score: A target score to be matched
    :Output, return:   Return list containing matches with top 10 scores and list with matches that has the same score of higher closest score wtih given score
    :Time complexity:   O(NM)
        Best: O(NM), N = length of results, M = number of characters within a team
        Worst: O(NM), N = length of results, M = number of characters within a team
    Sorting characters for all teams has time complexity of O(NM) as it calls character sorting that has O(M) time complexity N times
    Generating opposite result loops through the whole list, hence having time complexity of O(N)
    Sorting according to teams calls the sort_team function hence has time complexity of O(NM)
    Sorting according to score calls the sort_score function hence has time complexity of O(N)
    Finding top 10 matches has a worst case complexity of O(N)
    Searching the matches with the score has a worst case complexity of O(N)
    As a result, the time complexity of this function is mainly on characters sorting and team sorting, 
    Hence, the time complexity is O(NM).
    :Space complexity: O(NM), N = length of results, M = number of characters within a team
        Input: O(NM), N = length of results, M = number of characters within a team
        Aux: O(NM), N = length of results, M = number of characters within a team
    Both sort_team and sort_score has auxilary space complexity of O(NM) and 
    other parts of the function has constant auxilary space complexity, hence the space complexity for the function is O(NM)
